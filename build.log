[11:16:50] Devices are categorised as follows, from best to worst:
* [95mMain[0m: ports where mostly everything works.
* [94mCommunity[0m: often mostly usable, but may lack important functionality.
* [92mTesting[0m: anything from "just boots in some sense" to almost fully functioning ports.
* [93mDownstream[0m: ports that use a downstream kernel — very limited functionality. Not recommended.
