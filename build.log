[12:48:40] Devices are categorised as follows, from best to worst:
* [95mMain[0m: ports where mostly everything works.
* [94mCommunity[0m: often mostly usable, but may lack important functionality.
* [92mTesting[0m: anything from "just boots in some sense" to almost fully functioning ports.
* [93mDownstream[0m: ports that use a downstream kernel — very limited functionality. Not recommended.

If you're trying to select a device that is supported, check the following:

* Make sure you spelled the vendor name and codename correctly. 
* Check if you're on the right release branch. Devices in the 'downstream' category are only available on the 'edge' branch; if you selected a stable branch, run pmbootstrap init again and select 'edge'.
* If the device is supported by a generic port, type in the vendor and codename of the generic port.
